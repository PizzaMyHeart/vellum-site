<h1>About Vellum</h1>
<p>Vellum is inspired by NPR's <a href="https://apps.npr.org/best-books/">Book Concierge</a> and Lithub's <a href="https://bookmarks.reviews/">review aggregator</a>. As it says on the tin, Vellum is an aggregated list of nonfiction books that have been reviewed by academics on the websites mentioned below.</p>
<h2>Why did you make this?</h2>
<p>I love books, fiction or nonfiction. When looking for nonfiction on specialist topics written for the lay reader, I try my best to judge whether the book is factually sound before reading it. Some books make a huge splash before <a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/">their flaws are laid bare</a>—it takes an expert to uncover those flaws.</p>
<p>There are two types of nonfiction reviews written by academics: those about books written by experts for experts, and those about books written by experts for non-experts. I'm mostly interested in the latter kind of reviews, which are published online by some big-name journals and universities. Digging through their gleefully paginated blogs isn't the most pleasant experience, however, which is why I made this attempt at a better interface. I find this list easier to browse and the filters, while not 100% there*, help to narrow down the options. Note that the reviews themselves aren't displayed at all to avoid blatantly violating the journals' terms of service; instead, I've included links to the original reviews.</p>
<p>Besides, this was a fun excuse to play with</p>
<p>*<em>The keyword filters are generated from the source HTML and are therefore a little wonky. At some point I hope to clean and aggregate them into broader categories.</em></p>
<h2>Source of reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/articles?type=book-review"><em>Nature</em></a>*</li>
<li><a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/books/category/book/"><em>Science</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/"><em>LSE Review of Books</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>*<em>Most recent 100 reviews, as earlier reviews appear to be comprised mainly of very niche texts and edited collections.</em></p>

<h1>About this website</h1>
<p>I'm not a developer of any kind, so please forgive any defects in styling/functionality/optimisation. This is a basic static site generated with <a href="11ty.dev/">11ty</a>. Apart from the <a href="https://apoorv.pro/lozad.js/">lozad</a> and <a href="https://isotope.metafizzy.co/">Isotope</a> Javascript libraries, everything else is (poorly written) vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. This project could definitely use a database but I bent over backwards to minimise backend requirements. Don't ask me why.</p>
<p>I gathered the list of books with the help of my pet snake (ahem), whom I bribed with some <em>beautiful</em> soup and very humble <em>requests</em>. With JSON happily in hand, I queried the Google Books API for metadata, including the book descriptions and covers.</p>
<p>The website is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> for a grand total of Ð0.</p>
